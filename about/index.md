I am a Data Scientist at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). In May 2015 I received my PhD in [Quantitative and Computational Biology](http://www.princeton.edu/qcbgrad/) from Princeton University, where I worked with Professor [John Storey](http://www.genomine.org/). My interests include statistics, data analysis, genomics, education, and programming in R.
